"Open Tech" refers to technology that is transparent, inclusive and embodies the freedom to use, study, modify and redistribute to the maximum extent possible. 

The definitions of open-source software, open standards, and open-source hardware are well understood. "Open Tech" is used as an umbrella term that includes all of these technology areas. 

Open Tech can help India achieve techno-strategic autonomy, economic growth, technology leadership, and skill development. Transparency and inclusivity also help foster trust, broaden access to technology and further democratic values. 

We recommend a range of policy initiatives for software, hardware and standards that will nurture a sustainable Open Tech ecosystem.

### Software

- Adopt an open-source first policy in government procurement 
- Establish an open source programme office to coordinate policies, use and contribution of open source software (OSS) across government bodies 
- Inculcate OSS skills in the education curriculum 
- Fund existing open-source projects of interest to the government and public 
- Nurture a sustainable OSS community 
- Mandate acknowledgement of OSS Use

### Hardware

- Co-create robust open-source hardware products with like-minded partners 
- Award grants for open-source electronic design automation (EDA) tools 
- Open-Source the process design kit (PDK) of government research fabs

### Standards

- Promote the adoption of open standards 
- Participate actively in standards development organisations (SDOs) 
- Facilitate the development of open standards
